Python Virtual Assistant using Vosk
This is a project for a Python-based virtual assistant that uses the Vosk Speech-to-Text library. It is designed to be a voice-activated assistant that can perform a range of tasks, such as providing information, playing music, and making appointments.

# Dependencies
To use this virtual assistant, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.6+
- Vosk
- PyAudio
- Requests
You can install Vosk and PyAudio by running the following commands:

```
pip install vosk
pip install pyaudio
pip install requests
```
# Usage
To use the virtual assistant, simply run the main.py script in your terminal using the following command:

```
python main.py
```
You will need to provide your OpenAI API key to use the GPT-3 language model. Please refer to the OpenAI website for information on how to obtain an API key.

# Functionality
The virtual assistant is still under development and currently only has basic functionality. Some of the tasks it can perform include:

- Playing music
- Providing information on weather and news
- Creating reminders and appointments
- Setting alarms and timers
- Answering general questions
# Limitations
The virtual assistant is still a work in progress and has some limitations. It may not always understand complex commands or questions, and its responses may not always be accurate or helpful. Additionally, it may not be able to perform certain tasks that require external integrations or access to specific services.

$ Future Development
Future development for the virtual assistant may include:

- Integrating with additional services and APIs to provide more functionality
- Improving speech recognition accuracy and natural language processing capabilities
- Implementing machine learning algorithms to improve the assistant's ability to learn and adapt to user preferences
- Adding support for multiple languages
